# Library App — Backend API

A RESTful API for a social book-sharing app. Users can manage a personal book library and wishlist, connect with friends, and lend or borrow each other's books.

**Live API:** https://readshare-api.onrender.com/api
**Frontend repo:** https://github.com/J-greaves/readshare

---

## Purpose

This API serves a React Native mobile app that lets users track their book collections and share them with friends. The core features are:

- **Users** — create and retrieve user accounts
- **Book library** — add, view, and remove books from a personal collection; filter by lendable status
- **Wishlist** — maintain a list of books to acquire
- **Friends** — send, accept, and reject friend requests; manage a friends list
- **Borrowing/Lending** — request to borrow a friend's book, accept or decline requests, track active loans, and return books

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js 18 |
| Framework | Express |
| Database | Firestore (Firebase NoSQL) |
| Hosting | Render |
| Containerisation | Docker |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A Firebase project with Firestore enabled
- A Firebase service account key (JSON)

### Environment Variables

Create a `functions/.env` file:

```
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT={"type":"service_account","project_id":"..."}
PORT=3000
```

`FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` must be the service account JSON as a single-line string. To generate one, go to your Firebase project → Project Settings → Service Accounts → Generate New Private Key.

### Run with Node

```bash
cd functions
npm install
npm start
```

### Run with Docker

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t library-api .

# Run with env file
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file functions/.env library-api
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
